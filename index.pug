					h3 the start
					| Whether I believe it or not, its 8am and I fly into Narita to start my travels. We clear passport control, get on the local train into Tokyo using small tickets.

					| Then we get into our hotel room and eat some interesting shushi.

					h3 robot expedition
					| Despite our jetlag (intensified by our apartment being on a very busy road), we went to the Miraikan Museum, dedicated to robots, where we saw Asimo. At Gundam shopping centre, we had a VR ride called Attack On Titan made after a popular anime series.

					h3 anime adventure!
					| We went to Ikebukuro anime district to buy merchandise for my sister, Isabelle. It was very noisy and busy, so daddy walked us through a huge park for some peace and quiet, but this turned out to be a cemetery. Then we went to a lovely restaurant just behind the cemetery to avoid the rush hour on the underground.

					h3 out of toykyo
					| We got up early to vacate our lovely little flat and Isabelle helped us to get on the right bullet train from Tokyo to Hackoni where we will visit mount fuji. We had a lovely &ldquo;bento box&rdquo; lunch which we had to hurry for as to not miss our train.

					h3 everything Hakone
					| We woke up at 10! Having awoken at 5 then listening to the birds for ages. It&rsquo;s nice and calm here, so different to Tokyo! Got out about 11, breakfast of doughnuts and plum cider (soda &#x1F606;) at ninja caf&eacute;. Personally, I quite liked this breakfast, but my dad somewhat disagreed. Then took a funicular and cable car to the top. Over sulphurous gasses coming out of the volcano aka rotten egg smell.
					img(src='imgs/6/rotten egg gases.jfif' alt='solfres gases rising from Hakone volcano')
					| We can also just see Mount Fuji. At the top is a large-ish tourist centre that simply wasn&rsquo;t there 17 years ago. So, buy some tourist tat for my mum, Stef, Mike, and Marty and Mary, take in the views, and go down on the next cable car to the shores of lake Ashi, stop for a nice lunch with great views over the lake, then rush off to the pirate ship home. Which we miss, so we wait 35 minutes for the 3 o&rsquo;clock Boat ride, which is pleasant if crowded, and we then get the bus back to Yanussen or there about for the Picasso museum just 30 minutes before it shuts, and we don&rsquo;t deem it worth it for the frankly high entry fee. So, disappointed we get the tram (romance car) back to the hotel.
